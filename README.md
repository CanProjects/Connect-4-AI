# Connect4

A very strong machine learning based approach to Connect4, incorporating no prior game knowledge. Inspired by deepmind's alphazero. The implementation combines multiple different approaches to game solving, including min-maxing, monte carlo tree search, and machine learning (using a convolutional neural network) to classify/evaluate the strength of positions.
